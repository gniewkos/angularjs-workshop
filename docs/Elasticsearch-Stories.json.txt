And with your permission and all of that, you are interacting with the things going on in the room.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is not an especially outlandish forecast, given the trajectory of connected devices. Analyst Gartner calculated there were some 3.8 billion such \\u2018smart objects\\u2019 in use last year, and forecast 4.9 billion this \\u2014 rising to 25 billion in circulation by 2020. (The global human population was estimated at around seven billion, at the last count.) In other words the sensornet is here, it\\u2019s just not densely (or evenly) distributed yet.\\n\\nGoogle already owns Nest, a maker of connected devices for the home, such as a smoke alarm and learning thermostat. Google-Nest also owns Dropcam, a Wi-Fi security camera maker. Mountain View is clearly making a bid to be the nexus of the \\u2018connected home\\u2019 \\u2014 which, along with the \\u2018connected car\\u2019 (of course Google is also building driverless, Internet-tethered cars), is the early locus for the sensornet. See also: wearables (\\u2018connected people\\u2019), and the fact smartphones are gaining additional embedded sensors, turning our pervasive pocket computers into increasingly sensory mobile data nodes.\\n\\nOne of Davos\\u2019 more outlandish (perhaps) predictions for our increasingly connected future came from a group of Harvard professors who apparently sketched a scenario where mosquito sized-robots buzz around stealing samples of our DNA, as reported by Mail Online. \\u201cPrivacy as we knew it in the past is no longer feasible,\\u201d computer science professor Margo Seltzer is quoted as saying. \\u201cHow we conventionally think of privacy is dead.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat Seltzer was actually arguing is that it needs no sneaky, DNA-sealing robo-mosquitos for connected technologies to violate our privacy.

Let alone anything so futuristic as robotic mosquitos.\\n\\n\\u201cThe high order message is that we don\\u2019t need pervasive sensor net technologies for this to be true. We merely have to use technologies that exist today: credit cards, debit card, the web, roads, highway transceivers, email, social networks, etc. We leave an enormous digital trail,\\u201d she added.\\n\\nSeltzer was also not in fact arguing for giving up on privacy \\u2014 even if the Mail\\u2019s article reads that way. But rather for the importance of regulating data and data usage, rather than trying to outlaw particular technologies.\\n\\n\\u201cTechnology is neither good nor bad, it is a tool,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHowever, hammers are tools too. They are wonderful for pounding in nails. That doesn\\u2019t mean that someone can\\u2019t pick up a hammer and use it to commit murder.

Similarly, the laws surrounding privacy need to be laws about data and usage, not about the technology.\\u201d\\n\\nWith your permission\\n\\nWhat especially stands out to me from Schmidt\\u2019s comments at Davos is his afterthought caveat \\u2014 that this invisible, reactive, all-pervasive future sensornet will be pulling its invisible strings with your permission.\\n\\nPerhaps he was paying lip-service to the warning of the FTC\\u2019s Chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, at CES earlier this month that building connected objects \\u2014 the long discussed \\u2018Internet of Things\\u2019 \\u2014 demands a new responsibility from businesses and startups to bake security and privacy protections into their products right from the get go.\\n\\n\\u201c[The Internet of Things] has the potential to provide enormous benefits for consumers, but it also has significant privacy and security implications,\\u201d she warned. \\u201cConnected devices that provide increased convenience and improve health services are also collecting, transmitting, storing, and often sharing vast amounts of consumer data, some of it highly personal, thereby creating a number of privacy risks.\\u201d\\n\\nRamirez said that without businesses adopting security by design; engaging in data minimization rather than logging everything they can; and being transparent about the data they are collecting \\u2014 and who else they want to share it with \\u2014 by providing notifications and opt outs to users; then the risks to users\\u2019 privacy and security are enormous.\\n\\nThe problem with those well-meaning words from a consumer watchdog organization is that we are already struggling to achieve such rigorous privacy standards on the current Internet \\u2014 let alone on a distributed sensornet where there\\u2019s no single, controllable entry point into our lives.

Unless some kind of regulatory layer is also erected to provide a framework for usage that works in the interests of privacy and consumer control.\\n\\nWithout such consumer-oriented controls embedded into this embedded Internet, the user effectively loses the ability to take themselves offline, given that the most basic level of computing control \\u2014 the on\\/off switch \\u2014 is being subducted beneath the grand, over-arching utility of an all-seeing, always on sensornet. (Battery life constraints, in this context, might be viewed as a privacy safeguard, although low power connectivity technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy, work to circumvent that limit.)\\n\\nIn parallel, a well-distributed Internet of Things likely demands greater levels of device automation and autonomy, given the inexorable gains in complexity generated by a dense network of networked objects. And because of the sheer number of connected devices. And more automation again risks reducing user control.\\n\\nConnected objects will be gathering environmental intelligence, talking to each other and talking to the cloud. Such a complex, interwoven web of real-time communications might well generate unique utility \\u2014 as Schmidt evidently believes. But it also pulls in increased privacy concerns, given how many more data points are being connected and how all those puzzle pieces might slot together to form an ever more comprehensive, real-time representation of the actions and intentions of the people moving through this web.\\n\\nEarlier generation digital technologies like email were not engineered with far-sighted privacy protections in mind. Which is why they have been open to abuse \\u2014 to being co-opted as part of a military industrial surveillance complex, as the Snowden revelations have shown, offering a honeypot of metadata for government intelligence agencies to suck up. Imagine what kind of surveillance opportunities are opened up by an \\u2018invisible\\u2019 Internet \\u2014 which is both everywhere but also perceptually nowhere, encouraging users to submit to its data-mining embrace without objection.

The more intelligence on web users Google can harvest, the more data it can package up and sell to companies who want to sell you stuff. Which, for all Google\\u2019s primary-colored, doodle-festooned branding, is the steely core of its business. Mountain View has long talked about wanting search to become predictive. Why? Because marketing becomes a perfect money-pipe if corporates can channel and influence your real-time intentions. That\\u2019s the Google end game.\\n\\nLearning about human intention from the stuff people type into search engines is laughably crude compared to how much can be inferred from a sensornet that joins up myriad, real-time data-dots and applies machine learning data-mining algorithms dynamically. More dots are already being joined by Google, across multiple web products and its mobile platform Android \\u2014 which brings it a rich location layer. Doing even more and deeper data mining is a natural evolution of its business model. (Related: Google acquired AI firm Deep Mind last year \\u2014 a maker of \\u201cgeneral-purpose learning algorithms\\u201d.)\\n\\nThe core reality of the Internet of Things is that a distributed network of connected objects could be deliberately engineered to catch us in its web \\u2014 triangulating our comings and goings as we brush past its myriad nodes. The more connected objects surround us, the more data points wink into existence to be leveraged by the Googles of the digital world to improve the accuracy and texture of their understanding of our intentions, whether we like it or not.\\n\\nSo while the future Internet may appear to fade into the background, as Schmidt suggests, that might just signify a correspondingly vast depth of activity going on in the background. All the processing power required to knit together so many connections and weave a concealed map of who we are and what we do.\\n\\nThe risk here, clearly, is that our privacy is unpicked entirely. That an embedded \\u2018everywhere Internet\\u2019 becomes a highly efficient, hugely invasive machine analyzing us at every turn in order to package up every aspect of our existence as a marketing opportunity. That\\u2019s one possible future for the sensornet.\\n\\nBut it seems to me that that defeatist argument is also part of the spinning which vested interests like Google, whose business models stand to benefit massively, engage in when they discuss the digital future that they are trying to shape. Technology is a tool. Diverse applications are possible. And just because technology makes something possible does not also mean it is inevitable.\\n\\nAs Seltzer says, we need to be thinking about how we want the data to flow or not flow, rather than throwing our hands up in horror or defeat. What is also clearly necessary \\u2014 indeed, I would argue, is imperative \\u2014 is joined up thinking from regulators to comprehend the scope of the privacy risks posed by increasingly dense networks of networked objects, and how the accumulation of data-points can collectively erode consumer privacy. A clear-sighted strategy for ensuring end users can comprehend and control the processing of their personal data is paramount.\\n\\nWithout that, the risk for startup businesses playing in this space is that the rise of more and more connected devices will be mirrored by a parallel rise in human mistrust of increasingly invasive products and services.\\n\\nIn the hyper personal realm of the Internet of Things, user trust is paramount. So building a framework to regulate the data flows of connected devices now, while the sensornet is still in its infancy, is imperative for everyone involved.\\n\\nIn the offline world we have cars and roads. We also have speed limits \\u2014 for a reason. The key imperative for regulators now, as we are propelled towards a more densely-packed universe of connected devices, is coming up with the sensornet\\u2019s speed limits.

A few seconds later, I hear the boiler sparking up before the central heating finally kicks in. It\\u2019s a familiar sound, but this time the experience is profoundly different.\\n\\nI break out in a smile knowing that I will never again need to take a stick and whack the boiler\\u2019s out-of-reach array of switches each time I want to override the central heating schedule or adjust its settings. Nor will I have to ask somebody else to operate the central heating for me. The future is here and it just got a little more evenly distributed.\\n\\nThe smart home \\u2014 which at its most basic is enabling various devices around the home, such as thermostats, lighting and door locks, to be connected to the Internet and controlled via a smartphone \\u2014 is going to be a huge boon to accessibility. However, like a lot of technology before it, this vision of the future has been prohibitively expensive (and often overly complex), putting it beyond the reach of many, including people like me who have a physical disability and for whom smart home technology could potentially make the most difference. That\\u2019s starting to change.\\n\\nMore recently, a raft of new smart home products have been coming to market, both from traditional consumer electronics companies and startups alike, helped by the rise in crowdfunding via platforms like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo. Unlike the uber smart home systems traditionally sold by smart home specialists, however, these new generation of products tend to take a small pieces, loosely joined approach that makes it easier (and cheaper) to dip a toe in the smart home waters.\\n\\nThe disadvantage, of course, is that discrete devices, by their very nature, don\\u2019t always talk to one another, requiring a separate app each to operate, and aren\\u2019t nearly as smart as they could be. But that too is changing.\\n\\nFor iOS users, Apple has unveiled HomeKit, its own (somewhat locked down) platform for integrating third-party smart home devices, letting them interact with each other, as well as with Apple\\u2019s Siri.\\n\\nGoogle-owned Nest is also opening up through its \\u201cWorks with Nest\\u201d developer program, which positions the company\\u2019s Nest Learning Thermostat as the hub of the smart home, enabling other apps and devices to utilise the smart thermostat\\u2019s motion sensor and feed into its self-learning capability.\\n\\nOthers vying to become a smart home standard are Quirky\\u2019s Wink, and Samsung-acquired SmartThings. The Internet of Things \\u2018recipe\\u2019 service IFTTT is also doing a good job at providing some level of interoperability between disparate smart devices.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still early days, however, and this is reflected in the cobbled-together nature of my own smart home setup. It currently sports a Hive smart thermostat from British Gas, two sets of smart lightbulbs from Philips and LIFX, a Belkin smart plug and motion sensor, and an Apple AirPlay-enabled home audio system.\\n\\nBut, while my approach has been tentative so far, I\\u2019ve already experienced enough first-hand to know that, just like other enabling technology before it, the smart home has the potential to change my world for the better.\\n\\nBritish Gas Hive Active Heating\\n\\nHive Active Heating is a smart thermostat from UK energy household name British Gas, with technology provided by AlertMe. The device replaces your existing thermostat and boiler switch, enabling your home\\u2019s central heating to be programmed and controlled via the excellent Hive iOS and Android smartphone apps, or the Hive website.\\n\\nCommands are actually sent via the cloud, so require the Hive system to be permanently connected to the Internet in addition to your home\\u2019s WiFi network. However, this also means you\\u2019re able to toggle your heating even when you are away from home, which is especially convenient on a freezing British winter\\u2019s night.\\nMore recently, British Gas has added geo-location features to alert you if you accidentally leave the heating on when leaving the house or if you\\u2019re returning home and the temperature is set lower than you find comfortable.\\n\\nOn the downside, Hive Active Heating doesn\\u2019t feel especially smart, at least not compared to other smart thermostats on the market. Here I\\u2019m thinking of Nest\\u2019s self-learning algorithms that help it understand how long your home takes to heat up in various weather conditions, or Tado\\u2019s geo-fencing functionality that means it can be set to automatically switch on your heating as you approach home.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s no open API yet either, meaning that other smart home devices and apps can\\u2019t interact with Hive, though I\\u2019m hopeful this will change in the future. However, none of the above takes away from Hive\\u2019s accessibility credentials; being able to control the central heating via my laptop and smartphone has been truly empowering.\\n\\nPros\\n\\nWell-designed apps for iOS, Android and web.\\nControl your central heating and hot water when you are away from home.\\nUnlike competitors, Hive Active Heating includes free installation from a qualified British Gas engineer.\\nDoesn\\u2019t over-rely on the use of the Hive apps but reassuringly includes physical controls on the Hive thermostat itself.\\nCons\\n\\nConsists of three separate hardware components: a hub, receiver, and thermostat.\\nNot especially smart and no API for integration with third-party apps.\\nPhilips Hue\\n\\nPhilips Hue is a \\u2018connected\\u2019 lighting system that comprises various LED-based colour-changing lightbulbs and other lighting products, which can be controlled over your local WiFi network and, optionally, the cloud. Like Hive, the Hue\\u2019s main accessibility draw is the ability to adjust your home\\u2019s lighting via a smartphone.\\n\\nMy setup consists of a Hue starter kit (see our full review), providing three LED multicoloured lightbulbs, and the required Hue hub, which can talk to up to 50 bulbs on the same local area network. This lets me use my iPhone to switch any of the three Hue bulbs \\u2014 two in the lounge and one in the hallway \\u2014 on and off, along with adjusting their intensity and colour. The latter feels a tad gimmicky at first but soon becomes a great way of changing up the atmosphere of a room, which is especially useful as somebody who works predominantly from home.\\n\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one accessibility caveat, however: If someone turns the lights off at the existing wall switch, the corresponding Hue lightbulbs no longer receive power and are therefore temporally disconnected from the network and can\\u2019t be controlled by the Hue app. This isn\\u2019t an issue specific to Philips Hue, but is common across almost all connected lighting solutions. Nonetheless, until you retrain your household\\u2019s collective muscle memory, be prepared to lose that new-found independence at the flick of a switch.\\n\\nThe other major plus of Hue is its growing ecosystem, which is already seeing an increasing number of third-party apps and services add support for Philips\\u2019 connected lighting. This means, for example, that you aren\\u2019t stuck using the official iOS and Android app, which is just as well since it\\u2019s overly complex and not particularly intuitive.\\n\\nPros\\n\\nSet up was super quick and easy, even if I wasn\\u2019t keen on putting yet another hub in my living room.\\nNice looking bulbs.\\nExcellent developer support, resulting in a plethora of third-party apps and service integration.\\nControl you bulbs over the cloud so you can make it look like someone is home even when they aren\\u2019t.\\nCons\\n\\nOverly-complex and unintuitive official app.\\nAt only 600 lumens, the Hue connected lightbulbs could be brighter.\\nDoesn\\u2019t come in bayonet versions, thus requiring an adaptor for use in most British households.\\nLIFX\\n\\nStartup LIFX is a direct competitor to Phillips Hue, and offers a similar accessibility proposition: the ability to control your home\\u2019s lighting via smartphone apps and the cloud. However, unlike Hue, the LIFX connected bulbs don\\u2019t require a separate hub and, instead, connect directly to your home WiFi network. As a result, they are more expensive per bulb, but have less upfront cost, since you don\\u2019t need to purchase a starter kit but can begin with a single bulb.\\n\\n\\nA few other noticeable differences compared to Hue: The LIFX bulbs are considerably brighter, running at a maximum of 1,017 lumens, and colours seem more vibrant, which may be important depending on your take on multicoloured lighting. The official LIFX app for iOS and Android is also a lot more intuitive than Philips Hue.\\n\\nHowever, third-party support and the platform as a whole feels less mature, although this is steadily improving. The LIFX bulbs themselves are pretty bulky, too, and can run rather hot at times.\\n\\nPros\\n\\nAt around 1,000 lumens, LIFX bulbs are significantly brighter than Hue.\\nIntuitive app for iOS and Android.\\nDoesn\\u2019t require a hub.\\nCons\\n\\nBulbs are bulky and may suit a longer lampshade depending on your current setup.\\nThird-party support isn\\u2019t as widespread as Hue.\\nExpensive per bulb, despite a cheaper entry cost.\\nBelkin WeMo Switch + Motion\\n\\nThe Belkin WeMo Switch + Motion is my first foray into home automation, rather than making the home smarter simply by being connected. It consists of two hardware components: a WiFi-enabled power plug\\/outlet, and an accompanying motion sensor, which can be placed somewhere else in the home.\\nThe former lets you turn devices on and off via the WeMo Switch and app, providing a similar accessibility advantage as the other smart home devices. The latter, meanwhile, goes one step further, and enables devices to be switched on and off based on motion, such as people entering and exiting a room, together with other rules, like time of day \\u2014 all programmed via the very intuitive WeMo app.\\n\\nWhile I haven\\u2019t quite figured out the ideal accessibility use case for motion detection, one example I\\u2019ve played with is having a fan come on and off depending on whether or not anybody is in the room. By combining IFTTT, which WeMo supports, you could also, theoretically, set a rule that adjusts this behaviour based on local weather conditions, too. If the outside temperature is low, don\\u2019t switch on the fan regardless of any motion detected.\\n\\nPros\\n\\nVery easy to install and configure.\\nIntuitive iOS and Android app, and rule-based system.\\nSupport for IFTTT, extending the possibilities of basic home automation.\\nCons\\n\\nThe Belkin Switch is quite bulky and may not allow for another device to be plugged in side-by-side on a typical UK twin power outlet.\\nExpensive to get started.\\nApple\\u2019s AirPlay\\n\\nApple\\u2019s AirPlay technology, which lets compatible devices stream audio (and video and photos) to each other, should probably count as the start of my smart home journey, although I didn\\u2019t know it at the time.\\n\\nThrough the combination of an iPhone, iMac, Airport Express WiFi adaptor, and the excellent AirFoil app, I\\u2019m able to stream and control music from my smartphone or computer to two separate home audio\\/speaker setups in the lounge and bedroom\\/home office, respectively. This includes music stored in iTunes, and other sources, such as Spotify running on my laptop.\\nOnce again, the accessibility advantage is the ability to remotely control my digital music collection and connected home audio system via an app.\\n\\nPros\\n\\nMostly it \\u2018just works\\u2019.\\nWidespread support on iOS.\\nLots of AirPlay-compatible connected speakers on the market.\\nCons\\n\\nOne of a number of competing media streaming standards, so support isn\\u2019t as ubiquitous as it could be.\\nApple\\u2019s AirPort Express is expensive, though there are cheaper third-party alternative AirPlay-compatible WiFi adaptors available.\\nWHAT\\u2019S NEXT?\\n\\nThe burgeoning smart home currently means different things to different people. As it stands, for a device to qualify as being \\u2018smart\\u2019 it simply needs to be connected, either locally and\\/or via the cloud \\u2014 and this alone provides greater accessibility. However, over the next few years, the smart home is going to become a lot smarter by making better use of data and increasing integration between devices and platforms, with the end-goal being home automation.\\n\\nRight now, smart home devices tend to give you a lot of control but require far too much intervention; as my colleague Natasha Lomas says, an app for everything is not particularly smart or liberating. In contrast, the idea behind home automation is to have the home take care of you, rather than you needing to take care of it.\\n\\nThis could be anything from blinds automatically opening and closing, based on factors such as time of day, ambient lighting or weather conditions, or the lamp in your home office coming on as you approach your desk, via the use of Beacon technology (an idea I\\u2019m going to explore after recently backing Airfy\\u2019s successful Kickstarter campaign).\\n\\nIn fact, with a new generation of smart home devices coming to market that pack an array of sensors, from motion or proximity detection, to something that measures air quality, the possibilities of home automation are going to become almost limitless. And it\\u2019s not hard to see how that future could further improve accessibility and the lives of people with disabilities. Or anybody else, for that matter. Just how I like it.\"\n}\n ","dataMode":"raw","timestamp":0,"version":2,"time":1424428094644},{"collectionId":"e3a4c9e9-b6be-b130-74e6-4f938353358e","id":"b1b65510-1dc4-799f-c482-1d51f4def374","name":"SEARCH stories with highlight","description":"","url":"http://localhost:9200/stories/story/_search","method":"POST","headers":"","data":"{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"match_phrase\" : {\n            \"body\" : \"connected\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"highlight\" : {\n        \"fields\" : {\n            \"body\" : {\"fragment_size\" : 200, \"number_of_fragments\" : 10}\n        }\n    }\n}","dataMode":"raw","timestamp":0,"responses":[],"version":2},{"collectionId":"e3a4c9e9-b6be-b130-74e6-4f938353358e","id":"fb2516a1-0446-004e-76b1-662395b1d427","name":"CREATE Story - what happens to privancy","description":"","url":"http://localhost:9200/stories/story/1","method":"PUT","headers":"","data":"{ \n  \"title\": \"What Happens To Privacy When The Internet Is In Everything\",\n  \"link\": \"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/25/what-happens-to-privacy-when-the-internet-is-in-everything/\",\n  \"body\": \"This week Google\\u2019s Eric Schmidt was on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he suggested that the future Internet will be, in one sense, invisible \\u2014 because it will be embedded into everything we interact with.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Internet will disappear,\\u201d he predicted (via The Hollywood Reporter). \\u201cThere will be so many IP addresses\\u2026so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with that you won\\u2019t even sense it. It will be part of your presence all the time.\\n\\n\\u201cImagine you walk into a room, and the room is dynamic. And with your permission and all of that, you are interacting with the things going on in the room.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is not an especially outlandish forecast, given the trajectory of connected devices. Analyst Gartner calculated there were some 3.8 billion such \\u2018smart objects\\u2019 in use last year, and forecast 4.9 billion this \\u2014 rising to 25 billion in circulation by 2020. (The global human population was estimated at around seven billion, at the last count.) In other words the sensornet is here, it\\u2019s just not densely (or evenly) distributed yet.\\n\\nGoogle already owns Nest, a maker of connected devices for the home, such as a smoke alarm and learning thermostat. Google-Nest also owns Dropcam, a Wi-Fi security camera maker. Mountain View is clearly making a bid to be the nexus of the \\u2018connected home\\u2019 \\u2014 which, along with the \\u2018connected car\\u2019 (of course Google is also building driverless, Internet-tethered cars), is the early locus for the sensornet. See also: wearables (\\u2018connected people\\u2019), and the fact smartphones are gaining additional embedded sensors, turning our pervasive pocket computers into increasingly sensory mobile data nodes.\\n\\nOne of Davos\\u2019 more outlandish (perhaps) predictions for our increasingly connected future came from a group of Harvard professors who apparently sketched a scenario where mosquito sized-robots buzz around stealing samples of our DNA, as reported by Mail Online. \\u201cPrivacy as we knew it in the past is no longer feasible,\\u201d computer science professor Margo Seltzer is quoted as saying. \\u201cHow we conventionally think of privacy is dead.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat Seltzer was actually arguing is that it needs no sneaky, DNA-sealing robo-mosquitos for connected technologies to violate our privacy. The point is, she later told TechCrunch, we are already at a privacy-eroding tipping point \\u2014 even with current gen digital technologies. Let alone anything so futuristic as robotic mosquitos.\\n\\n\\u201cThe high order message is that we don\\u2019t need pervasive sensor net technologies for this to be true. We merely have to use technologies that exist today: credit cards, debit card, the web, roads, highway transceivers, email, social networks, etc. We leave an enormous digital trail,\\u201d she added.\\n\\nSeltzer was also not in fact arguing for giving up on privacy \\u2014 even if the Mail\\u2019s article reads that way. But rather for the importance of regulating data and data usage, rather than trying to outlaw particular technologies.\\n\\n\\u201cTechnology is neither good nor bad, it is a tool,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHowever, hammers are tools too. They are wonderful for pounding in nails. That doesn\\u2019t mean that someone can\\u2019t pick up a hammer and use it to commit murder. We have laws that say you shouldn\\u2019t murder; we don\\u2019t specialize the laws to call out hammers. Similarly, the laws surrounding privacy need to be laws about data and usage, not about the technology.\\u201d\\n\\nWith your permission\\n\\nWhat especially stands out to me from Schmidt\\u2019s comments at Davos is his afterthought caveat \\u2014 that this invisible, reactive, all-pervasive future sensornet will be pulling its invisible strings with your permission.\\n\\nPerhaps he was paying lip-service to the warning of the FTC\\u2019s Chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, at CES earlier this month that building connected objects \\u2014 the long discussed \\u2018Internet of Things\\u2019 \\u2014 demands a new responsibility from businesses and startups to bake security and privacy protections into their products right from the get go.\\n\\n\\u201c[The Internet of Things] has the potential to provide enormous benefits for consumers, but it also has significant privacy and security implications,\\u201d she warned. \\u201cConnected devices that provide increased convenience and improve health services are also collecting, transmitting, storing, and often sharing vast amounts of consumer data, some of it highly personal, thereby creating a number of privacy risks.\\u201d\\n\\nRamirez said that without businesses adopting security by design; engaging in data minimization rather than logging everything they can; and being transparent about the data they are collecting \\u2014 and who else they want to share it with \\u2014 by providing notifications and opt outs to users; then the risks to users\\u2019 privacy and security are enormous.\\n\\nThe problem with those well-meaning words from a consumer watchdog organization is that we are already struggling to achieve such rigorous privacy standards on the current Internet \\u2014 let alone on a distributed sensornet where there\\u2019s no single, controllable entry point into our lives. The Internet and the mobile Internet can still be switched off, in extremis, by the user turning off their router and\\/or powering their phone down (and putting it in the fridge if you\\u2019re really paranoid, post-Snowden).\\n\\nBut once a distributed sensornet has achieved a certain penetration tipping point, into the objects with which we humans are surrounded, well then the sheer number of devices involved is going to take away our ability to trivially pull the plug. Unless some kind of regulatory layer is also erected to provide a framework for usage that works in the interests of privacy and consumer control.\\n\\nWithout such consumer-oriented controls embedded into this embedded Internet, the user effectively loses the ability to take themselves offline, given that the most basic level of computing control \\u2014 the on\\/off switch \\u2014 is being subducted beneath the grand, over-arching utility of an all-seeing, always on sensornet. (Battery life constraints, in this context, might be viewed as a privacy safeguard, although low power connectivity technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy, work to circumvent that limit.)\\n\\nIn parallel, a well-distributed Internet of Things likely demands greater levels of device automation and autonomy, given the inexorable gains in complexity generated by a dense network of networked objects. And because of the sheer number of connected devices. And more automation again risks reducing user control.\\n\\nConnected objects will be gathering environmental intelligence, talking to each other and talking to the cloud. Such a complex, interwoven web of real-time communications might well generate unique utility \\u2014 as Schmidt evidently believes. But it also pulls in increased privacy concerns, given how many more data points are being connected and how all those puzzle pieces might slot together to form an ever more comprehensive, real-time representation of the actions and intentions of the people moving through this web.\\n\\nEarlier generation digital technologies like email were not engineered with far-sighted privacy protections in mind. Which is why they have been open to abuse \\u2014 to being co-opted as part of a military industrial surveillance complex, as the Snowden revelations have shown, offering a honeypot of metadata for government intelligence agencies to suck up. Imagine what kind of surveillance opportunities are opened up by an \\u2018invisible\\u2019 Internet \\u2014 which is both everywhere but also perceptually nowhere, encouraging users to submit to its data-mining embrace without objection. After all how can you resist what you can\\u2019t really see or properly control?\\n\\n\\nAll the debate about security services getting access to encrypted apps is a smokescreen. #IoT means they'll be able monitor you anyway\\n\\n\\n\\u2014 Dean Bubley (@disruptivedean) January 14, 2015\\n\\n\\nThat is exactly the Internet that Schmidt wants to build, from his position atop Google\\u2019s ad sales empire. The more intelligence on web users Google can harvest, the more data it can package up and sell to companies who want to sell you stuff. Which, for all Google\\u2019s primary-colored, doodle-festooned branding, is the steely core of its business. Mountain View has long talked about wanting search to become predictive. Why? Because marketing becomes a perfect money-pipe if corporates can channel and influence your real-time intentions. That\\u2019s the Google end game.\\n\\nLearning about human intention from the stuff people type into search engines is laughably crude compared to how much can be inferred from a sensornet that joins up myriad, real-time data-dots and applies machine learning data-mining algorithms dynamically. More dots are already being joined by Google, across multiple web products and its mobile platform Android \\u2014 which brings it a rich location layer. Doing even more and deeper data mining is a natural evolution of its business model. (Related: Google acquired AI firm Deep Mind last year \\u2014 a maker of \\u201cgeneral-purpose learning algorithms\\u201d.)\\n\\nThe core reality of the Internet of Things is that a distributed network of connected objects could be deliberately engineered to catch us in its web \\u2014 triangulating our comings and goings as we brush past its myriad nodes. The more connected objects surround us, the more data points wink into existence to be leveraged by the Googles of the digital world to improve the accuracy and texture of their understanding of our intentions, whether we like it or not.\\n\\nSo while the future Internet may appear to fade into the background, as Schmidt suggests, that might just signify a correspondingly vast depth of activity going on in the background. All the processing power required to knit together so many connections and weave a concealed map of who we are and what we do.\\n\\nThe risk here, clearly, is that our privacy is unpicked entirely. That an embedded \\u2018everywhere Internet\\u2019 becomes a highly efficient, hugely invasive machine analyzing us at every turn in order to package up every aspect of our existence as a marketing opportunity. That\\u2019s one possible future for the sensornet.\\n\\nBut it seems to me that that defeatist argument is also part of the spinning which vested interests like Google, whose business models stand to benefit massively, engage in when they discuss the digital future that they are trying to shape. Technology is a tool. Diverse applications are possible. And just because technology makes something possible does not also mean it is inevitable.\\n\\nAs Seltzer says, we need to be thinking about how we want the data to flow or not flow, rather than throwing our hands up in horror or defeat. What is also clearly necessary \\u2014 indeed, I would argue, is imperative \\u2014 is joined up thinking from regulators to comprehend the scope of the privacy risks posed by increasingly dense networks of networked objects, and how the accumulation of data-points can collectively erode consumer privacy. A clear-sighted strategy for ensuring end users can comprehend and control the processing of their personal data is paramount.\\n\\nWithout that, the risk for startup businesses playing in this space is that the rise of more and more connected devices will be mirrored by a parallel rise in human mistrust of increasingly invasive products and services.\\n\\nIn the hyper personal realm of the Internet of Things, user trust is paramount. So building a framework to regulate the data flows of connected devices now, while the sensornet is still in its infancy, is imperative for everyone involved.\\n\\nIn the offline world we have cars and roads. We also have speed limits \\u2014 for a reason. The key imperative for regulators now, as we are propelled towards a more densely-packed universe of connected devices, is coming up with the sensornet\\u2019s speed limits. And fast.\"\n}\n ","dataMode":"raw","timestamp":0,"version":2,"time":1424428061007}]}
